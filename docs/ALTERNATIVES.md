Web Console is not a web-based terminal emulator - you might want to try [Shell In A Box](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox).

Web Console is not a web-based remote access system - we can recommend [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) (and our own [Remote Gateway](https://github.com/dhicks6345789/remote-gateway) project) for web-based access to RDP, SSH and VNC sessions, or [noVNV](https://novnc.com/info.html) for web-based VNC access.
