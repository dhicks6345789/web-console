# Web Console Is Not:
- A web-based terminal emulator - you might want to try [Shell In A Box](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox).
- A web-based remote access system - we can recommend [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) (and our own [Remote Gateway](https://github.com/dhicks6345789/remote-gateway) project) for web-based access to RDP, SSH and VNC sessions, or [noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html) for web-based VNC access.
- A [low-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform) development tool - it can remove some complexity around the implementation and hosting of web applications with a basic GUI, but will still need some (hopefully, fairly beginner-level) coding skills.
- A beginner's learn-to-code tool. Web Console doesn't provide a learning environment by itself, the expectation is that you're writing real-world scripts and applications with a purpose other than simply as a programming exercise. That said, Web Console should hopefully be suitible for beginners with very little programming experience who want a basic environment to start putting code into - often the best way to learn is to start implementing something and see how far you get. Also, being an application that can be self-hosted on a company (or school's) own hardware, it can provide a programming environment where local administrators can implement filtering rules or other security restrictions as appropriate for the environment.
- A mobile app development platform - Web Console is entirely web-based, it doesn't produce code ready to be uploaded to Google or Apple's app stores. It should, however, work just fine on a web browser running on phone or tablet (it should, hopefully, support installation as a progressive web app (PWA) at some point) and can be a good way of getting your applications directly into the hands of your mobile users.
- A full Integrated Development Environment like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). It does have a integrated code editing facility, though, based on the [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) code editor, which does provide quite a reasonable code editing solution.
- A client-side code development tool. Web Console, importantly, runs code server-side, not in the browser as something like [Replit](https://replit.com/) does.
- Language specific. Web Console implements a GUI by interpreting the text (STDOUT, STDERR) output from command-line applications written in any language, whether those are ineterpreted scripting languages or running as compiled executables. Web Console should be able to deal with pretty much any language you can get working on the command line accross Windows, Linux and Mac - it should be very cross-platform. You can even use it to add a web-based graphical user interface to an old DOS-era .BAT file.
- As comprehensive as modern web frameworks such as [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or similar. It probably isn't suitible for larger applications, and its GUI capabilities aren't on a par with something like [React](https://reactjs.org/). If you want to be implementing proper, modern web applications, Web Console isn't the application for you. It should, however, allow you to write quick-and-dirty scripts that can take some basic user input and get them in front of users in minimal time.
- A replacement for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), although Web Console Tasks can easily be triggered from GitHub Actions, so it can be a useful tool to run some code locally on a server when something happens on a repository.
- A dedicated build / continuous integration (CI/CD) tool such as [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), although it does come in very handy as a tool to be able to trigger a build script from a single web page and see the output and get errors reported. As it can also be used to trigger builds from a GitHub action (and other locations) it can be used as a basic CI tool, too.
- A hosted service, like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Web Console runs on your server, under your control - you are responsible for installation and maintaining the server. That does mean that all code and data is also under your control, so if you need a solution that stops data leaving your own hardware, Web Console might be the better solution.
- Proprietary. Web Console is open source, using a permissive [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), meaning you can use and modify it for free, whether for personal use or commerical gain, with no obligation to share any modifications. You can take this project and use it as the basis for a commercial offering if you want, no need to ask permission or pay any licensing fees. This also means the source code is open to anyone to audit for security purposes.
- Complex. At the most basic, the user interface for end users consists of one large, green button with "Run" written on it and an output section - this is an application designed to be used by end users with very limited IT skills. Even the code-editing facilities are simplified - programming can be done in pretty much any language, scripted or compiled (even a DOS / Windows .BAT file). Web Console isn't the best learn-to-code environment, but it can be a good tool for a beginner programmer after learning the basics, enabling them to get their code in front of end-users.
- A large / comprehensive project. Web Console's codebase is quite compact, the build process is relativly simple, it's the kind of size that one developer should be able to get their head around it for auditing / modification purposes. It does pretty much one thing (runs scripts server-side and reproduces the output client-side on a web page), there isn't too much you need to understand to use / run it.
- Warrantied / guaranteed in any way - as with any software or service, do check the license agreement to make sure it matches you or your organisation's needs / expectations. In common with most software (open source or otherwise), there is no guarantee this project will even run on your system or not cause issues with existing software or data. We will try and respond to any queries or requests for help, but you have no gaaruntee of a response in case of a problem.
- A fully-featured web server. Web Console is written in Go, and acts as a basic web server, which makes it easy to get up and running. However, it is expected that in production it will be used behind some kind of proxy server (we recomend [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), which makes handling HTTPS certificates very simple) or a [tunneling service](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling). Support is now built-in for [Cloudflare's Zero-Trust platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/lp/ppc/zero-trust-network-access-x/) and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), which both offer tunneling protected by OAuth-based (Google, Microsoft, etc) authentication. Web Console does not, by itself, handle HTTPS connections, and is therefore probably unsuitible to be used on any public-facing Internet address. However, it can come in handy as a local-only web server for a decicated kiosk machine if you want a browser-based interface to some local code - our [Device Config](https://github.com/dhicks6345789/device-config) project might also be useful for this kind of application.
- High performance. Web Console stores configuration data and user settings in simple text-based files which are read in during each operation, it is not optomised for performance. It should be able to handle in the region of tens of Tasks and hundreds of users, more than that and it might struggle. This way of operating does mean it should be easy to export lists of user data to Web Console, you can have scripts simply dump lists of valid users in Task folders and they'll be read straight away during the next operation.
- Designed as a local development environment, although actually it can work quite well in that context. The web server itself is fully self-contained, and the web-based user interface generated relies only on a self-hosted version of Bootstrap, so running Web Console on a non-Internet-connected machine should work quite well.
- A self-contained, single cross-platform executable, like [Redbean](https://redbean.dev/). Web Console, written in Go, compiles to an executable that then relies on finding a set of files on the filesystem. See the [installation](INSTALLATION.md) instructions for a list of platforms executables are provided for, but it should run on any platform supported by Go.
- As mature (yet!) as something like [QuickServe](https://github.com/jstrieb/quickserv).
- Certified in any way, although we hope to have security certifications in place for milestone releases at some point.
- The only tool in this space. Some similar(-ish) tools include:
  - [Windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/) - an open source platform to turn scripts into workflows and UIs in minutes.
  - [Airplane](https://www.airplane.dev/) - Developer infrastructure for internal tools.
  - [Ansible AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) - provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).
  - [Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com/) - Runbook automation.
  - [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) - Build great things at any scale.
  - [Onu](https://joinonu.com/) - Turn scripts into internal tools in minutes, no frontend work required.
  - [Fastgen](https://fastgen.com/) - Quickly build scalable backends / workflows / automations / APIs.
- Finished! As of writing, Web Console is really still only a beta, not even a version 1 yet. Plans for Version 2 are for it to be able to handle user inputs via various web-based input components, at which point it should become a much more useful project.
