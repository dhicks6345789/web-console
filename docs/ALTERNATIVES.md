# Alternatives - Web Console Is Not:

- A web-based terminal emulator - you might want to try [Shell In A Box](https://github.com/shellinabox/shellinabox).
- A web-based remote access system - we can recommend [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) (and our own [Remote Gateway](https://github.com/dhicks6345789/remote-gateway) project) for web-based access to RDP, SSH and VNC sessions, or [noVNV](https://novnc.com/info.html) for web-based VNC access.
- A [low-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform) development tool - it can remove some complexity around the implementation and hosting of web applications with a basic GUI, but will still need some (hopefully, fairly beginner-level) coding skills.
- A beginner's learn-to-code tool. Web Console doesn't provide a learning environment by itself, the expectation is that you're writing real-world scripts and applications with a purpose other than simply as a programming exercise. That said, Web Console should hopefully be suitible for beginners with very little programming experience who want a basic environment to start putting code into - often the best way to learn is to start implementing something and see how far you get.
- A full Integrated Development Environment like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). It does have a basic integrated code editing facility, though.
- A client-side code development tool. Web Console, importantly, runs code server-side, not in the browser as something like [Replit](https://replit.com/) does.
- A tool or library for a specific language. Web Console implements a GUI by interpreting the text (STDOUT, STDERR) output from command-line applications written in any language, whether those are ineterpreted scripting languages or running as compiled executables. Web Console should be able to deal with pretty much any language you can get working on the command line accross Windows, Linux and Mac - it should be very cross-platform. You can even use it to add a web-based graphical user interface to an old DOS-era .BAT file.
- As comprehensive as modern web frameworks such as [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or similar. It probably isn't suitible for larger applications, and its GUI capabilities aren't on a par with something like [React](https://reactjs.org/). If you want to be implementing proper, modern web applications, Web Console isn't the application for you. It should, however, allow you to write quick-and-dirty scripts that can take some basic user input and get them in front of users in minimal time.
- A replacement for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), although Web Console Tasks can easily be triggered from GitHub Actions, so it can be a useful tool to run some code locally on a server when something happens on a repository.
- A dedicated build / continuous integration (CI) tool, although it does come in very handy as a tool to be able to trigger your build script from a single web page and see the output and get errors reported. As it can also be used to trigger builds from a GitHub action (and other locations) it can be used as a basic CI tool, too.
- A hosted service, like [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). Web Console runs on your server, under your control - you are responsible for installation and maintaining the server. That does mean that all code and data is also under your control, so if you need a solution that stops data leaving your own hardware, Web Console might be the better solution.
- A fully-featured web server. Web Console is written in Go, and acts as a basic web server, which makes it easy to get up and running. However, it is expected that in production it will be used behind some kind of proxy server (we recomend [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), which makes handling HTTPS certificates very simple) or a tunneling service. Web Console does not, by itself, handle HTTPS connections, and is therefore probably unsuitible to be used on any public-facing Internet address. However, it can come in handy as a local-only web server for a decicated kiosk machine if you want a browser-based interface to some local code - our [Device Config](https://github.com/dhicks6345789/device-config) project might also be useful for this kind of application.
- High performance. Web Console stores configuration data and user settings in simple text-based files which are read in during each operation, it is not optomised for performance. It should be able to handle in the region of tens of Tasks and hundreds of users, more than that and it might struggle. This way of operating does mean it should be easy to export lists of user data to Web Console, you can have scripts simply dunmp lists of valid users in Task folders and they'll be read straight away during the next operation.
- Designed as a local development environment, although actually it can work quite well in that context. The web server itself is fully self-contained, and the web-based user interface generated relies only on a self-hosted version of Bootstrap, so running Web Console on a non-Internet-connected machine should work quite well.
- Finished! As of writing, Web Console is really still only a beta, not even a version 1 yet. Plans for Version 2 are for it to be able to handle user inputs via various web-based input components, at which point it should become a much more useful project.

# Web Console Is (or is, at least, intended to be):

- Simple to use for end users. Web Console should make it relativly easy to write some code and get it in front of users as quickly as possible, with authentication and authorisation handled for you.
- Simple to develop for. Programming can be done in pretty much any language, scripted or compiled (even a DOS / Windows .BAT file). Web Console can be the beginner programmer's next step after learning the basics of a language.
